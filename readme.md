## Installation

To set up DebugZilla on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- MongoDB (for backend database)
- Google Gemini API Key (for AI-powered code analysis)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/debugzilla.git
   cd debugzilla
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm run ia
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:

   - Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` directory with the following variables:
     ```
     MONGODB_URI=<your-mongodb-uri>
     JWT_SECRET=<your-jwt-secret>
     PORT=5000
     GEMINI_API_KEY=<your-gemini-api-key>
     CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5173
     NODE_ENV=development
     GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=<your-github-client-id>
     GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=<your-github-client-secret>
     GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<your-google-client-id>
     GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=<your-google-client-secret>
     BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5000
     FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
     ```
   - Create a `.env` file in the `frontend/` directory with the following variable:
     ```
     VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
     ```

4. **Start the application**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start both the frontend and backend servers concurrently.

5. **Access the application**:
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` to start using DebugZilla.
